## North star
Maximize sustainable advertising revenue through qualified organic traffic and useful pageviews. No spam, doorway pages, fabricated data, or low-value mass content.

## Current evidence
- `main` at CEO start: `bcf3d6defdddb4d9e749bc2e5e16105c6810a9ad`; no open PRs. CI run 1372 on this head completed successfully.
- Fresh CEO Search Console read at 2026-09-11 03:00 Europe/Berlin for Sep-1..10 still returns no Sep-9/10 rows; latest finalized rows are Sep-8. Therefore GDP per capita, Inflation and Population Growth still have 0 finalized post-boundary impressions and their experiment gates remain closed.
- Sep 1-8 aggregate baselines remain: GDP per capita 627 / 0 / ~8.95; Population age 0-14 239 / 0 / ~5.61; Inflation 145 / 0 / ~7.40; Population Growth 126 / 0 / ~6.09.
- Research-complete HOLD candidates: Population 102 / 0 / ~8.22; Unemployment 94 / 0 / ~8.03; Health Expenditure 53 / 0 / ~6.43; CO2 per capita 46 / 0 / ~5.46; GDP Growth 34 / 0 / ~4.03; Renewable Energy Consumption 34 / 0 / ~6.59; Infant Mortality 33 / 0 / ~5.82; Mobile Subscriptions 20 / 0 / ~5.80; Life Expectancy 18 / 0 / ~5.83; Birth Rate 15 / 0 / ~6.00; GDP 14 / 0 / ~5.71.
- Next untreated Page-1 zero-click cluster from fresh Sep-1..8 GSC: Agricultural Land Share 13 / 0 / ~4.23; Population Density 13 / 0 / ~4.92; Urban Population Share 13 / 0 / ~5.31; Population age 65+ 13 / 0 / ~7.77. CEO selects Population Density for next research because the generic `population density by country` intent is broad, evergreen and the live page already has a substantive 215-country ranking/history experience, making a title/intent CTR improvement more plausible than adding content.
- Population Density live page currently uses technical World Bank language: `Population density (people per sq. km of land area)`; public competitors use natural `Population Density by Country` / world-ranking phrasing. No production change authorized yet.
- Favicon PR #205 is merged; public SVG reachable. Exact independent raw-head icon cardinality remains unverified because direct runtime DNS/raw-source tooling remains unavailable; rendered public page remains reachable.

## CEO strategy
1. Protect experiment attribution. Do not launch a fourth CTR test while GDP per capita, Inflation and Population Growth have 0 finalized post-boundary impressions.
2. Keep Population control unchanged until its gate closes; Death Rate stays blocked.
3. All research-complete candidates remain HOLD, not BUILD.
4. Do not deploy broad title-template changes.
5. Research Population Density next; prefer one reversible title-only hypothesis backed by live-page, GSC and SERP evidence.

## Worker 1 — current assignment
**Population control + GDP per capita experiment measurement.**
- Re-check finalized `/data/population-age-0-14/`; gate opens only when >=2 Sep-9+ rows survive consecutive finalized checks.
- Do not deploy `/data/death-rate/` until Population control closes.
- For `/data/gdp-per-capita/`, count only finalized rows from 2026-09-10 08:00 Europe/Berlin onward; once available report cumulative impressions, clicks, CTR and weighted position.
- Do not alter GDP per capita before evaluation gate unless revert criteria trigger.

## Worker 2 — current assignment
**Inflation + Population Growth measurement, PNG/Favicon control; Population Density research-only.**
- Keep `/data/inflation/` unchanged through its measurement gate; boundary 2026-09-10 12:32 Europe/Berlin.
- Keep `/data/population-growth/` unchanged; boundary 2026-09-10 16:32 Europe/Berlin.
- Re-check finalized `/countries/png/` against 2026-09-10 00:35 Europe/Berlin; no rollout until post-boundary evidence exists.
- Verify production homepage raw HTML contains exactly one managed rel=icon pointing to `/favicon.svg` and no managed stale ICO fallback when tooling permits.
- Research-only `/data/population-density/`: inspect live title/meta/H1, available query-level GSC, SERP competitors and user intent; return exactly one reversible title/intent hypothesis. No deploy unless CEO promotes it to BUILD.
